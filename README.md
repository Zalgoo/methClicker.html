## How to Play

* **Click for Meth!**: Click the main button to produce meth. Your **MPC (Meth Per Click)** determines the amount you get.
* **Buy Upgrades**: Use meth to increase your MPC or your **MPS (Meth Per Second)**, which generates meth automatically.
* **Commit Crimes**: This "rebirth" mechanic resets your game but grants a **Criminal Charge**. These charges better upgrades.
* **Offline Production**: The game continues to produce meth while you're away. A pop-up will offer you your earnings when you return.

* **Rebirth System**: A strategic mechanic to unlock permanent bonuses.
